# Explainable Medical Image Captioning

This repository contains the code and materials for my diploma project on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) applied to medical image captioning.

## Project Overview
Medical image captioning is the task of generating descriptive, clinically relevant text based on radiology images. This project implements an encoder-decoder architecture with attention and explainability mechanisms, inspired by the paper:  
**"Explainability for Medical Image Captioning" (Beddiar et al.)**

## Status
Code will be added once reviewed and finalized.


## License
This project is for academic purposes only.
