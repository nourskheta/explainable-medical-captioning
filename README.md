# Explainable Medical Image Captioning

This repository contains the code and materials for my diploma project on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) applied to medical image captioning.

## Project Overview
Medical image captioning is the task of generating descriptive, clinically relevant text based on radiology images. This project implements an encoder-decoder architecture with attention and explainability mechanisms, inspired by the paper:  
**"Explainability for Medical Image Captioning" (Beddiar et al.)**

## Status
Code will be added once reviewed and finalized.

## Structure
- `model/`: Code for model architecture and training
- `data/`: Dataset info or links
- `report/`: Final technical report (to be added)
- `outputs/`: Sample results (attention maps, captions, etc.)

## License
This project is for academic purposes only.
